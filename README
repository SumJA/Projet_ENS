Introduction :

We have data on gene families. For each gene, we have data about genes alignments, genes tree ans genes expression.
In this web application, we group all this data. This website makes it possible to visualize all the data, for a gene
or for a family.

For this project, you need to have a python version superior to 3.1.

I Data Base
 1. How to import data
Check the connection to mysql server : mode "strcit" disabled.
mysql -e "SELECT @@sql_mode;"



II Django
 1. Installation

sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo aptitude install python3-django
sudo pip install django


 2. Utilization

To use Django, you need to create a virtual environment.
EXPLIQUER COMMENT CREER L'ENVIRONNEMENT
To activate the environment, write this command into a terminal : source environment_name/bin/activate
python manage.py runserveur 127.0.0.1:8000

III Data visualization
 1. Expression

 2. Alignment
 3. Tree
To visualize genes tree, you need to install "ETE3" in your computer. For this : pip (or pip3) --upgrade
and after : pip (or pip3) easyinstall ete3.
